## Project Insights
-The dashboard reveals that a single zone contributes the majority of total revenue, highlighting regional concentration in sales performance.
-Top-tier markets such as metro cities dominate both sales volume and revenue generation.
-A small number of key customers account for a significant share of total revenue, indicating high dependency on top clients.
-Revenue trends show fluctuations over time, with noticeable peaks and declines, suggesting the presence of seasonal demand patterns.
-Certain markets generate high sales volume but relatively lower revenue, indicating possible pricing or discounting strategies.
-Time-based analysis helps identify strong and weak performance periods, supporting better sales forecasting.
-The dashboard enables quick comparison of zone-wise and market-wise performance using interactive filters.
